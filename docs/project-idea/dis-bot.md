# Chat bot for people with disabilities

A Twitch bot that uses audio only commands can help make the streaming experience more accessible for streamers who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse due to a physical disability or other condition. By allowing streamers to control certain aspects of their stream using just their voice, this bot can help to reduce the physical strain of streaming and make it more accessible for a wider range of people.

For example, the bot could be used to allow the streamer update counters, change the game/title, and other basic controls. This would make the streaming process less cumbersome for streamers who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.

So, by using an audio-only bot, Twitch streamers with disabilities or conditions that make it difficult to use a keyboard or mouse can still stream and interact with their audience in a more accessible way. Twitch's mission to make the website useable for everyone, that can be further enhanced by this kind of bot, and it could be a great addition to Twitch's current accessibility features.
