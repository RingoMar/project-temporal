# Event Bot 
A Twitch bot that uses audio only to act on events from a Twitch stream, such as specific words said by the streamer, could be a useful tool for streamers who want to interact with their audience in a more dynamic and engaging way. This could be done by having the bot listen for specific keywords or phrases in the stream's audio and then performing an action based on those keywords.

Another example could be if the streamer says a specific word or phrase in the stream, the bot could automatically execute a command such as starting a poll, displaying a message on the screen, or triggering a sound effect. This could be used to enhance the overall viewing experience for the audience.

This kind of bot could be built using a combination of technologies such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and real-time audio processing, found in OpenAi's [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)
