Project Temporal is a research project aimed at developing new techniques for dealing with twitch bots and audio. Some possible projects that could be built using the research from Project Temporal
<!--truncate-->
# Chat bot 
A Twitch bot using audio only commands from the streamer could allow the streamer to control certain aspects of their stream without needing to use their keyboard or mouse. This could be useful for streamers who want to keep their hands free for other tasks, such as playing a game or drawing.

One possible implementation of this bot would be to use vocal range matching to match the voice of the streamer. This could involve analyzing the streamer's voice in real-time and comparing it to a pre-recorded sample of their voice. If a match is detected, the bot could then execute the corresponding command.

For example, the streamer could say "start music" or "stop music" to control the background music during the stream. Or "start countdown" to start a countdown timer on the screen.

Another example could be using different pitch and tone of the streamer's voice to control the volume of the stream or other settings.

## Chat bot for people with disabilities

A Twitch bot that uses audio only commands can help make the streaming experience more accessible for streamers who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse due to a physical disability or other condition. By allowing streamers to control certain aspects of their stream using just their voice, this bot can help to reduce the physical strain of streaming and make it more accessible for a wider range of people.

For example, the bot could be used to allow the streamer update counters, change the game/title, and other basic controls. This would make the streaming process less cumbersome for streamers who may have difficulty using a keyboard or mouse.

So, by using an audio-only bot, Twitch streamers with disabilities or conditions that make it difficult to use a keyboard or mouse can still stream and interact with their audience in a more accessible way. Twitch's mission to make the website useable for everyone, that can be further enhanced by this kind of bot, and it could be a great addition to Twitch's current accessibility features.


# Event Bot 
A Twitch bot that uses audio only to act on events from a Twitch stream, such as specific words said by the streamer, could be a useful tool for streamers who want to interact with their audience in a more dynamic and engaging way. This could be done by having the bot listen for specific keywords or phrases in the stream's audio and then performing an action based on those keywords.

Another example could be if the streamer says a specific word or phrase in the stream, the bot could automatically execute a command such as starting a poll, displaying a message on the screen, or triggering a sound effect. This could be used to enhance the overall viewing experience for the audience.

This kind of bot could be built using a combination of technologies such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and real-time audio processing, found in OpenAi's (Whisper)[https://openai.com/blog/whisper/]
